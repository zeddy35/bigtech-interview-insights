## ⏱️ Quick 5-Minute Prep

**Got a busy schedule?** Here's how to make the most of limited time:

```
Step 1 → Open companyproblem.vercel.app
Step 2 → Select your target company (e.g., "Google")
Step 3 → Set difficulty to "Medium" (most common in interviews)
Step 4 → Sort by frequency (highest first)
Step 5 → Practice the top 3 problems
```

**Why this works:**
- 📊 **High-frequency problems** = Most likely to appear in your interview
- ⚡ **Medium difficulty** = 60% of real interview questions
- 🎯 **Company-specific** = Tailored to your target employer

> *Pro tip: Repeat this daily for 2 weeks before your interview. You'll cover the most important patterns.*

## 💡 Interview Prep Tips

### 🗓️ 30-Day Study Plan

| Week | Focus | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Week 1** | Arrays & Strings | Filter by topic, solve top 20 by frequency |
| **Week 2** | Trees & Graphs | Focus on BFS, DFS, recursion patterns |
| **Week 3** | Dynamic Programming | Start with Easy, progress to Medium |
| **Week 4** | Company-Specific | Filter by your target company, review all |

### 🎯 Smart Practice Rules

1. **Quality over quantity** — 5 deep problems > 20 rushed solutions
2. **Follow frequency** — High-frequency problems appear for a reason
3. **Company patterns matter** — Google loves graphs, Amazon loves arrays
4. **Time yourself** — 25 min for Medium, 40 min for Hard
5. **Review weekly** — Revisit problems you struggled with

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| Solve random problems | Filter by company + frequency |
| Skip Easy problems | Warm up with 2-3 Easy daily |
| Memorize solutions | Understand the patterns |
| Ignore time limits | Practice with a timer |
| Study only algorithms | Include System Design topics |

## ⭐ What Engineers Are Saying

<div align="center">

### 🏆 Success Stories From Our Community

<br/>

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"I was mass applying to jobs without any real strategy. A friend shared this repo, and everything changed. The frequency data helped me focus on what actually matters. Three weeks later, I got callbacks from Google, Amazon, and Meta. Just accepted my offer at Google Zurich. This platform is a game-changer."*

**— M. K.** · Software Engineer @ Google

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"Coming from a non-CS background, I always felt like I was at a disadvantage. Paid platforms were too expensive for me. When I found this, I couldn't believe it was free. The company-specific filters saved me so much time. I focused on Amazon's top 50 questions and practiced for 2 months. Got the SDE II offer last week. Forever grateful."*

**— R. S.** · SDE II @ Amazon

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"I'm a self-taught developer from Istanbul. Honestly, I never thought working at a FAANG company was realistic for someone like me. This platform changed my mindset. The data is organized perfectly, the frequency scores are accurate, and it's completely free. I prepared for 6 weeks and got an offer from Meta London. Dreams do come true."*

**— E. Y.** · Frontend Engineer @ Meta

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"As a senior engineer, I needed something efficient. I don't have time to solve 500 random problems. This platform let me filter by company and difficulty, focus on high-frequency patterns, and prepare strategically. Landed a Staff Engineer role at Apple. The frequency scores are worth their weight in gold."*

**— J. L.** · Staff Engineer @ Apple

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"Career changer here — went from finance to tech. Everyone told me to pay for premium subscriptions. I found this instead. Six months of focused practice using the frequency data, and I'm now at Microsoft. Save your money, use this platform. It's genuinely better than the paid alternatives."*

**— A. T.** · Software Engineer @ Microsoft

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

*"The weekly updates are what sold me. Interview trends change, and this platform keeps up. I have my Netflix onsite next week, and I feel more prepared than ever. Whether I get the offer or not, this resource has been invaluable. Thank you to whoever maintains this."*
