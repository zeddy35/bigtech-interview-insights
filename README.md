## 🧠 The Insight

Here's what separates engineers who get offers from those who don't:

**They don't just practice problems. They practice the *right* problems.**

Every Big Tech company has patterns. Questions they love. Topics they focus on. Trends that change each quarter.

This project gives you that data. **For free. Updated weekly. Forever.**

## ⏱️ Quick 5-Minute Prep

**Got a busy schedule?** Here's how to make the most of limited time:

```
Step 1 → Open companyproblem.vercel.app
Step 2 → Select your target company (e.g., "Google")
Step 3 → Set difficulty to "Medium" (most common in interviews)
Step 4 → Sort by frequency (highest first)
Step 5 → Practice the top 3 problems
```

**Why this works:**
- 📊 **High-frequency problems** = Most likely to appear in your interview
- ⚡ **Medium difficulty** = 60% of real interview questions
- 🎯 **Company-specific** = Tailored to your target employer

> *Pro tip: Repeat this daily for 2 weeks before your interview. You'll cover the most important patterns.*

## 💡 Interview Prep Tips

### 🗓️ 30-Day Study Plan

| Week | Focus | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Week 1** | Arrays & Strings | Filter by topic, solve top 20 by frequency |
| **Week 2** | Trees & Graphs | Focus on BFS, DFS, recursion patterns |
| **Week 3** | Dynamic Programming | Start with Easy, progress to Medium |
| **Week 4** | Company-Specific | Filter by your target company, review all |

### 🎯 Smart Practice Rules

1. **Quality over quantity** — 5 deep problems > 20 rushed solutions
2. **Follow frequency** — High-frequency problems appear for a reason
3. **Company patterns matter** — Google loves graphs, Amazon loves arrays
4. **Time yourself** — 25 min for Medium, 40 min for Hard
5. **Review weekly** — Revisit problems you struggled with

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| Solve random problems | Filter by company + frequency |
| Skip Easy problems | Warm up with 2-3 Easy daily |
| Memorize solutions | Understand the patterns |
| Ignore time limits | Practice with a timer |
| Study only algorithms | Include System Design topics |
